# World COVID Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of global COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) using Google BigQuery. 
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a global scale.

## Data Source

The primary data source for this analysis is [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org), a reputable organization that provides a comprehensive dataset 
of COVID-19 statistics from around the world. The dataset includes information on cases, deaths, testing, vaccinations, and other relevant metrics.

## Tools Used

The analysis was conducted using Google BigQuery, a powerful cloud-based data warehouse provided by Google Cloud Platform. BigQuery allows for efficient querying 
and analysis of large datasets, making it ideal for processing and analyzing COVID-19 data on a global scale.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Extraction**: The COVID-19 dataset was extracted from Our World in Data's public data repository and loaded into Google BigQuery for further analysis.
   This dataset is regularly updated and includes historical data dating back to the early stages of the pandemic.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Prior to analysis, the data was cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. This step ensured the accuracy and reliability
   of the analysis.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various exploratory data analysis techniques were employed to understand the dataset's characteristics. This included summary
   statistics, data visualization, and trend analysis.

7. **Key Findings**: The analysis identified key findings related to the global spread of COVID-19, vaccination rates, mortality rates, and regional disparities.
   These findings provide valuable insights into the progression of the pandemic.

9. **Visualization**: To enhance the understanding of the data, visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps were created. These visual representations make it
    easier to grasp trends and patterns.

11. **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical tests and models were applied to the data to investigate correlations, associations, and predictive factors related to the pandemic.

12. **Interpretation**: The results of the analysis were interpreted in the context of the global COVID-19 situation, highlighting important implications and lessons learned.

## Repository Structure
